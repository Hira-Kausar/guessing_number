//This guess the number game is a short TypeScript/Node.js project that allows the user to guess the number 
//generated by the computer. There are also several ways to alter the game, like adding more rounds or 
//displaying the score. Itâ€™s quite simple and uses the random function to generate a number.

    message:'enter number',
    choices:["0","1","2","3","4"]
